Feedback dataset v0.1


Each file maps back to the original *.unlabeled dataset file. For example:

 train_0_0.dataset.unlabeled => train_0_0.dataset.results.valid

Each *.valid file contains a subset of the instances in the corresponding *.unlabeled file that have feedback from turkers.

A *.valid file contains information on the predictions paired with human feedback. A unit in this file is a group that looks like this:
