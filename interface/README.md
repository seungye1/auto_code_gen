# TODO
- Change *stat_functions.py* to return proper values..(i.e. not a string but the value itself)
- Change *frame.py* load so that it reads csv directly without calling extern func
- Plotting functions in *stat_functions.py* need to be thought out really well. Tried couple of things but doesnt seem to play nicely.
- Figure out what predict function in *stat_functions.py* is supposed to do..
- Comment *frame.py*
